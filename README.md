# blood-bank-management-gui-using-python-tkinter
this is a simple blood bank management gui using tkinter.
i have used tkinter as a front end and mysql as a backend(for database).
i have created options as follows-
    1.add donor
      (this will show a donor form which can be filled by admin.
      according to blood type blood stock will be updated by 1
      after submitting form.)
    2.search donor (according to blood group we can see donors)
    3.view blood stock(we can see available blood packets of each blood type)
    4.view donar list(for showing details of donors)
